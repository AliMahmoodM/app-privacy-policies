    <h2>Privacy Policy for Quran Recitations</h2>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Quran Recitations mobile application (the "App") created by AMM as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our App is designed to be simple and focused on its purpose. We want to be clear about the information we do **not** collect:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>We **do not** collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
        <li>We **do not** gather any information about your device's location.</li>
        <li>We **do not** track your activity across other apps or websites.</li>
        <li>We **do not** collect your device's IP address or any other unique identifiers for tracking purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information the App Accesses and Why</h3>

    <p>The App requires access to two things on your device to function correctly:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet Connection:</strong> The App connects to the internet solely to stream and download Quran recitation audio files from public servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Storage:</strong> If you choose to download a surah, the audio file is saved to your device's storage in a folder private to the App. This allows you to listen offline. The App does not access any other files on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    
    <p>Our app may use third-party services that could collect information. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Your use of the app is also subject to Google's Privacy Policy as the app is distributed through the Google Play Store.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The app is intended for a general audience.</p>
    
    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

    <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-12-01.</p>
